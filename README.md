# Reformed Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are reforming agile software development to make software development a saner, safer career choice. Therefore we prioritize:

* **Adaptability** over Predictability.  

* **Problem-solving** over Accountability.  

* **Making great, effective, profitable software** over delivering or adding value.  

* **Meeting customers' needs** over meeting management's specs and KPI's.  

* **Writing code** over having meetings about the plans to write code.  

* **Continuously iterating this month** over making a roadmap for this year.  

* **Using common sense** over adherence to a methodology.  

* **Accepting the tradeoffs and understanding cause-and-effect** over accepting and promoting that it rolls downhill.  

* **Simple TODO lists** over extensive planning software.  

* **Sustainable paces** over fast-paced, highly deat march grinds.  

* **Ounces of prevention** over pounds of cure.

This manifesto is a living document and is subject to change as we make new discoveries about creating better software.
